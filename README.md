# bug-test

## 1. Repository
  
A repository is the primary folder that contains your project's files. In `bug-test`'s case, it was created on the Github platform. (But can this can be done from a local project file as well?)

Copy this repository:

run the command 

`git clone <bugtestURL>` to copy it locally. 

If you haven't installed Git on your machine, you can find it [here](https://git-scm.com/). 

## 2. Branches

A branch, is a separate version of your project. A good analog example would be different drafts for an essay. 

CREATE a branch with `git checkout -b <branch_name>` 

This will create and switch to a new branch.

SWITCH between branches with `git checkout <branch_name>` 

This will move you to a different iteration of your project.

MERGE the best of two branches together with  `git merge <branch_name>` 
- QUESTION: How does this operation work? It probably merges the current branch that is active with the branch that you're merging to.

## 3. Commits: 

Commiting your work allows you to take a snapshot of your project's state and save the changes. 

**Staging Changes:** allows you to verify different parts of the project you want to keep.

**Commit Changes**: Saving the commit, and adding a note for colleagues about the changes. 

**Push Changes:** This is the act of sharing your *commit* with the colleagues. 

## 4. Pull Requests: 

A pull request is the process of sharing your work with colleagues for feedback and review before it is finalized / deployed. 

**Creating a pull request:** Show the proposed work and asking for their thoughts before submission. 

**Review and MERGE:** Reviewing is simply receiving feedback, and merging is incorporation of the code into the project, OR it is taking their suggestions and corrections to optimize the project. 

## 5. Collaboration:

**Add collaborators:** Adding collaborators 

**Forking Repositories:** Forking allows you to make a personal copy of a project and allows you to implement your own version of the project. 

## 6. Undoing Changes

Undoing changes allows you to fix mistakes or return to an earlier state of the project. 

**Discard Local Changes:** Erase little snippets of code that don't serve the project. 

**Undo Commits:** Simply reverse the changes and return to an earlier state of the project. 

**Reset Commit History:** Reset your commits to get to an old point in the project's history. 

## 7. GitHub Actions

Actions is a platform within the GitHub ecosystem that allows you to automate a lot of the actions discussed here. GH Actions can check for errors, manage branching, and more. 

## 8. Issues and Labels

List your issues, and categorize them with labels. 

## 9. README and Documentation:

The `README` file is part of virtually every repository. It serves as an introduction to the project. It will explain what this is all about, how to use it, and so on. Documentation, is the user's manual - it should answer common questions and explain parts of the code base. 

## Gitignore and License

As the name suggests, the gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore, such as temp files or sensitive non critical data. 

A license specifies the rules for using your project, like permissions and responsibilities for others who want to use it. 

Like anything worthwhile, it takes trial, error, research, and practice to get familiar with Git and the Github platform. Be patient, it is a required tool in the world of software and tech because it is a remarkable way to work with others on world changing projects.
